All expressions must be wrapped in brackets so instead of
cosh(1 + 2, 1)
is must be,
cosh((1 + 2), 1)
All self functions must be wrapped in brackets
so instead of
cosh(1!, 1);
it must be,
cosh((1!), 1);
If an expression is on its own aka "1 + 2" it must not be
surrounded by brackets
Can only take absolute values of true values aka 1, 2, 3 not cos(1)
